                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Reservations are made by contacting WTWS directly, herein after referred to as the
                                “Company”, or through an agent, if your booking is made by one.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                                Safaris are booked and only confirmed on receipt of a 50% deposit of the basic safari
                                rate. There shall be no binding contract until the deposit has been paid. Failure to
                                remit your deposit on time may result in an automatic release of the confirmed space and
                                the possible inability to reinstate your reservation. When the Company acknowledges
                                receipt in writing of the deposit to you, it shall be deemed to constitute acceptance
                                and confirmation of the reservation. By paying a deposit, you the client and WTWS are
                                deemed to be under contract for the dates quoted for your safari. Deposits are not
                                refundable- the very principle of accepting a deposit being to confirm arrangements, and
                                to mitigate the total loss of a safari booking in the event of a postponement or a
                                cancellation, and to ensure a commitment by both parties.

                                The balance is due on arrival before commencement of your safari. If the balance is not
                                paid on this date, the Company shall be entitled at its discretion to treat your
                                reservations as cancelled and consequently your deposit will be forfeit.

                                safari may be accepted- provided space is available, payment in full is received, and
                                documentation finalized before departure.

                                at the time. Otherwise deposit/the balance will be put forward to the new dates. In the
                                event of an agreed cancellation, the difference due on the full deposit will be billed

                                due (within 60 days ahead of safari starting date), and in the event the company does
                                not agree to a postponement, the whole basic safari fee is forfeited. If the company, at
                                its sole discretion, does agree to a postponement, the whole basic safari fee is
                                forfeit. If the company, at its sole discretion, does agree to a postponement, the
                                deposit (50 of the basic safari fee) will be forfeit.

                        In Kenya as it stands now, no wildlife trophies are allowed to be collected, bought with
                        intentions of being shipped outside the country. This is highly prohibited by the country’s
                        laws.
