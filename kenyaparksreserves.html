                    <p>The greatest attraction Nairobi has, is not in the city at all, but just outside- the Nairobi
                        National .
                        Of the more popular species, only the Elephant is an absentee, Hippo wallow in the river pools,
                        Giraffe
                        dominate the plains. Lion and Cheetah and in excess of fifty Rhino have made this park justly
                        famous. The Animal Orphanage, beside the main gate, provides sanctuary to orphans of the wild
                        from all over the country.</p>
                    <p>
                        Nairobi National Park is the first park to be gazetted by the Kenyan Government in 1964. It
                        covers an area of 44sq km.

                        Masai Mara National Reserve
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Everything is big in the Masai Mara (1,812 km/700 m). It is a reserve of breathless vistas, a
                        panorama of
                        vast rolling plains, hills and woodland groves, well watered by the lovely Masai Mara River.
                        This is Lion
                        and Elephant country, with Buffalo lurking in the forest and a super abundance of plains game,
                        but all this richness is secondary to the Masai Mara’s main attraction- the annual migration,
                        which takes place between July and September. Over a million Wildebeest, thousands of Zebras
                        with their attendant predators cross the Masai Mara River and spread across the plains in a
                        seemingly endless procession. Secretary birds and Crowned Cranes stalk sedately over the plains
                        and the effortless Bateleur is almost always in the sky. A journey into the Masai Mara by air is
                        scenically magnificent, with stunning views right across the Rift Valley and of two extinct
                        volcanoes standing out in the blue grey haze.

                    <p>
                        Rugged and remote, these wildlife reserves (298 km. /115 m) lie just within the fascinating
                        semi-desert
                        Northern Frontier District of Kenya. With a magnificent background of jagged, purple mountains,
                        they
                        provide some of the best and most colorful game viewing in the country. The tranquil Ewaso Nyiro
                        River
                        flowing through the park provides a natural habitat for crocodiles. Long necked Gerenuk, Grey’s
                        Zebra and graceful Reticulated Giraffe are species not found in the less arid areas to the
                        south. Elephant seek solace and contentment in the shallow waters of this river, which together
                        with Buffalo Springs, supports a large variety of African mammals, Cheetah and Leopard being
                        particularly well represented. A most impressive sight beside the pools and streams are great
                        flocks of sandgrouse, which come to drink every morning around 8.00 am as regularly as
                        clockwork. Doves and Guinea- Fowl abound and the giant Martial Eagle perched on some high
                        vantage point. Nanyuki 125km/ 80 miles Nyeri 185km/115 miles Isiolo 50 km/30 miles

                        This recently created reserve (130km/ 50m) lies due east of Buffalo Springs, with the Ewaso
                        Nyiro River
                        forming its northern boundary. A small gem in the wildlife wilderness, it takes its name from a
                        cone of
                        volcanic rock and evidence of its past intensity is demonstrated by the formidable larva flow at
                        the southern end of the reserve. The central attraction is the wide sauntering river, fringed
                        with acacia, doum palms and tamarind. Many small hills and springs make this rather a special
                        place and it shares the same faunal structure with its two larger neighbors. Isiolo 50 km/10

                        The Aberdares is the established name of a beautiful mountain range in the central highlands of
                        Kenya. Within these mountains is the Aberdares National Park (766 km/295 m) a fairy tale place
                        of dense forest, misty moorlands and alpine plants, where icy rivers plunge in glorious cascades
                        and waterfalls. The area is rich in wildlife. The salient stretching out towards the nearby town
                        of Nyeri was once an Elephant migration route, not used today. These great animals remain within
                        the park, together
                        with Buffalo, a wide variety of antelope, giant forest Hog and elusive Bongo. Tacazze and
                        Malachite Sunbird, Mountain Buzzard and African Goshawk are found in this area, where the

                        Amboseli National Park (3,810 km/1,289) is one of the finest areas in the country for big game

                    <p>

                        The combined area of Tsavo East and West National Parks (20,807 km/8,034 m) makes this one of
                        the world’s largest game sanctuaries. A model national park in layout, geophysical, animal and
                        plant diversity, situated midway between Nairobi and Mombasa, this starkly beautiful park
                        suffered considerable deprivation both in physical damage and animal loss in the 1970’s, but
                        this is now well past and today the is thriving once more. Of many natural wonders, Mzima
                        Springs is of outstanding interest, a marvelous eruption of underground waters arising in the
                        Chyulu Hills reaching the surface to form crystal clear pools, a haven for a rich wildlife
                        pageant. The wildlife in this park includes herds of Elephants and prides of Lion, some perhaps
                        descendants of the famous “Man-eaters of Tsavo”. Less common species include fringed-eared Oryx,
                        Klipspringer, striped Hyena and Caracal. South of the park is a private sanctuary with lovely
                        lakes and waterholes, which ensures an exciting variety of animals at all times of the year.
                        Lake Jipe in the extreme south west is a rich bird locality where Pygmy Geese and Black Heron
                        are common. Weaver birds and their fascinating nests are found throughout the park, as are
                        Fischer’s starling, Hornbills and Parrots.

                        Lake Nakuru, the world famous haunt of Flamingoes, is a beautiful shallow alkaline lake, just
                        south of
                        Nakuru township. Surrounded by acacia woodland and rich savannah, this park (368 km/142 m) is a
                        superb example of conservation at work in the wild. Originally and still considered one of the
                        finest ornithological sights in the world, it is now, with the assistance of the World Wildlife
                        Fund, providing sanctuary for Rothschild Giraffe, Rhino and Leopard. The edge of the lake is
                        frequently a crimson ribbon of Greater and Lesser Flamingoes, while Pelicans and other water
                        birds swim and Fish in Majestic flotilla formation.Naivasha 70 km/45 miles, Nyeri 170km/105

                        Valley only 1 hour from the township of Nakuru. This is a peaceful place of quite outstanding
                        beauty, a breeding ground for fresh water fowl of some significance and the home of the Njemps,
                        smaller cousins of the great Masai, who have abandoned the nomadic way of life for fishing in
                        fragile craft made of reeds. Visits to Lake Bogoria are arranged from this area. A place of

                        fumaroles are convincing
                        evidence of the origins of the Rift Valley.
